## Utilizing Python Loops
One of the great strengths of computer programs is that they can process an incredible amount of information far faster than we could do it manually. To achieve this we need to be able to loop through collections and sequences. In this hands-on lab, we'll work through the popular interviewing Fizz-Buzz problem by creating a script that will prompt the user for the number of items to process, and then print out either the number, "Fizz", "Buzz", or "FizzBuzz" for each number between 1 and the user-provided number.

To feel comfortable completing this lab you'll want to know how to do the following:

- Utilize `for` loops. Watch "The for Loop" video from the Certified Entry-Level Python Programmer Certification course.
- Nest conditionals and loops. Watch the "Nesting Loops and Conditionals" video from the Certified Entry-Level Python Programmer Certification course.
- Utilize the `range` type. Watch "Using `range`" video from the Certified Entry-Level Python Programmer Certification course.
